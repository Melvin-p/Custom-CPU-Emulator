# custom CPU Emulator

The CPU has no heap memory, only a stack and registers  
A small set of instructions are available for the CPU (possibly not turing complete will fix later)

A barebones assembler is provided for the CPU. The sample `program.txt` can be assembled with the
assembler and ran with the emulator.

assembler in particular could be implemented a lot better
